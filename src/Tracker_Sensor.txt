// --- Part 1: Normalization process ---

Different sensors may output different results for the same color and distance.

y = (x-Min)/(Max-Min), x is the original output from sensors

y = (x - Min) * 1000 / (Max - Min), After transformed, the output value will be in the range of 0~1000, in which 1000 means the sensor is far away from the black line, and 0 means the sensor is above the black line.

// --- Part 2: Weighted average ---

y = (0 * value0 + 1000 * value1 + 2000 * value2 + 3000 * value3 +4000 * value4) / (value0 + value1 + value2 + value3 + value4)

In which, 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 are the weights for the five detectors, respectively, from left to right. And value0~value4 are the data with normalization process.

Now, we can get the data in the range of 0~4000, which can tell you the position of the black line. For example, 2000 means the black line is in the middle of the module, 0 means the black line is on the leftmost side of the module, and 4000 means the black line is on the rightmost side of the module.

The width of the black line should be equal to or less than the distance of two sensors (16mm)!!

// --- Part 3: PID control ---

PID control can feedback and regulate the error with three factors, proportional (P), Integral (I), derivative (D). The followings are PID algorithm.

proportional = position - 2000;
derivative = proportional - last_proportional;
integral += proportional;

last_proportional = proportional;

power_error = proportional * Kp + integral * Ki + derivative * Kd;
