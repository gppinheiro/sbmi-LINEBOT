ADADRUIT TB6612 

PINOUTS:
    - VM (Vmotor) -> voltage for the motors, not for logic level. Keep this voltage between 4.5V and 13.5V.
    - Vcc -> this is the voltage for the logic levels. Set to the voltage logic you'll be using on your microcontroller. 5V for us!!
    - GND -> This is the shared logic and motor ground. All grounds are connected!!

    - INA1, INA2 -> these are the two inputs to the Motor A H-bridges
    - PWMA -> this is the PWM input for the Motor A H-bridges, if you dont need PWM control, connect this to logic high.
    - INB1, INB2 -> these are the two inputs to the Motor B H-bridges
    - PWMB -> this is the PWM input for the Motor B H-bridges, if you dont need PWM control, connect this to logic high. 
    - STBY -> this is the standby pin for quickly disabling both motors, pulled up to Vcc thru a 10K resistor. Connect to ground to disable. 

    - Motor A -> these are the two outputs for motor A, controlled by INA1, INA2 and PWMA
    - Motor B -> these are the two outputs for motor B, controlled by INB1, INB2 and PWMB
